Статус: gated engineering roadmap  
Текущий gate: RT-4 post-merge state sync — Issue #40 / Draft PR #41

## Главный порядок

```text
repository workflow and protection
-> local MOEX FAST metadata inspection
-> raw segment contract and deterministic replay
-> specialized MOEX T0/T1 FAST decoding
-> CI routing optimization
-> QSH retirement
-> RT-4 SPECTRA framing, sequencing and recovery
-> realtime data quality and books
-> research/backtest/paper
-> VPTS/certification
-> Owner-approved production only later
```

Следующий этап не начинается до закрытия текущего gate.

Issue #21: closed completed
PR #23: merged
Final reviewed PR head: a1443d3f909151d327b83042e43c1cc4c04cc732
Merge commit: 377618c360c165d88dde4cfe0cee87f8747cba03
Pre-merge CI #156: success
Post-merge CI #157: success
Owner-local Windows Release acceptance: inventory 15/15, PASS
```

Accepted T0/T1 implementation hashes and profile are recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.md`.

Accepted operators: field without operator, constant.

Excluded and fail-closed: default, copy, increment, delta, tail, generic dictionaries, references, generic groups outside accepted T0/T1 inventory, byteVector, decimal component operators and historical-profile compatibility.

### CI-1 — DONE

```text
Required-check-preserving routing
Docs-only smoke PR #32
Main SHA: 0699a533a1ed44a9d47e05b049aca4061bebaac0
Post-merge CI #165: success
```

### QSH retirement — DONE

```text
Issue #33
PR #34 merged
Main merge SHA: 7c05cfb979cd0144be508e41a6f3a6229bfab1cb
Post-merge CI #175: success
```

QSH/QScalp/OrdLog product support, old QSH L3/L2 book, Trading Lab QSH integration, tombstone job, `run_qsh` and QSH routing are retired and absent. `*.qsh` remains only a raw-market-data safety ban.

### Performance-first documentation — DONE

```text
Issue #36
PR #37 merged
Main merge SHA: 7a23f57eab119df98e4cea7eaf239ad504d4bb88
CI-2 caching postponed until a measured bottleneck
RT-4 selected as the next gate
```

### RT-4 specification — DONE

```text
Issue #38: closed completed
PR #39: merged

## Current documentation gate

```text
Issue #40: open
Draft PR #41: open
Branch: docs/issue-40-rt4-state-sync
Base main SHA: 136293ede211619b7d9198d85ed3afb0f2577514
Scope: state synchronization and bounded MOEX VPN evidence only
Allowed files: exactly four documentation files
Code, MiMo and RT-4 implementation: not authorized
Merge: not authorized
```

Required sequence:

```text
complete four-file documentation diff
-> docs-only CI
-> Architecture Review
-> separate Owner readiness authorization
-> separate Owner merge authorization
-> post-merge main CI verification
-> separate Owner authorization for RT-4 Gate A implementation
```

## MOEX connectivity checkpoint

```text
FAST access for the registered external static IPv4: confirmed by MOEX support
Official Windows VPN parameters: PPTP; data encryption optional
Current home external IPv4: matches registered address
Windows VPN: error 807
TCP 1723 to supplied endpoint: unreachable from registered connection
Windows Firewall default outbound policy: Allow
Endpoint-specific enabled outbound block: not found
Third-party antivirus/network filter: not found
MOEX support follow-up: pending
```

Private connection addresses, credentials, VPN profiles and real raw/decoded market-data packets are prohibited in Git.

The connectivity blocker does not prevent synthetic Gate A implementation after separate Owner authorization, but production endian acceptance still requires live T0/T1 evidence, an official vector or written MOEX confirmation.

## RT-4 implementation gates — NOT STARTED

### Gate A — framing, sequencing and gaps

```text
4-byte UDP preamble and one current FAST body
explicit LittleEndian or BigEndian; no default guess
uint32 serial arithmetic with fail-closed ambiguity handling
A/B logical-feed arbitration and duplicate suppression
bounded reordering and fixed monotonic deadline
gap confirmation and terminal fail-closed state
fixed bounded storage and zero post-init allocations
synthetic Windows/Linux Release tests
Release benchmark and allocation evidence
```

### Gate B — replay and decoder integration

```text
RT-2 .mxraw A/B replay merge
RT-3 exact-body integration
compare external preamble with decoded tag 34
one-time endian AutoVerify and per-feed lock
stream initialization and SequenceReset policy
```

### Gate C — Snapshot recovery

```text
queue Incremental while recovering
apply complete Snapshot cycle and LastFragment rules
replay contiguous queued Incremental messages
fail closed on ambiguity, overflow or unresolved second gap
```

### Gate D — Release acceptance

```text
Windows/MSVC and Linux/GCC end-to-end Release evidence
latency distribution, throughput, allocations and memory behaviour
real T0/T1 packet, official vector or written MOEX confirmation
explicit Owner acceptance
```

No gate begins automatically. Each implementation stage requires a separate Issue, feature branch, existing PR workflow, tests, commit, push, CI, Architecture Review and Owner approval.

CI-2 caching is POSTPONED, not started and not authorized. Reconsider only when measured CI duration or cost materially slows development.

## Later stages

```text
RT-5 realtime data quality and normalized events
RT-6 ORDERS-LOG L3/L2 and storage
RT-7 T0 pilot and measured capacity
RT-8 research/backtest/paper on certified data
RT-9 FIX/TWIME test and VPTS readiness
RT-10 production certification and explicit Owner gate
```

RT-5 is prohibited until RT-4 is accepted, merged by the Owner and verified by post-merge CI.

Future normalized events and the new L3/L2 book are designed from official MOEX SPECTRA data; no automatic reuse of the old QSH code. Names and scope of later stages remain provisional until the preceding gate supplies evidence.
